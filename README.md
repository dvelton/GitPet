# 🐾 GitPet

**Your GitHub activity just got a little cuter.**
GitPet is a digital companion that grows, thrives, and plays based on your GitHub contributions. Commits, PRs, issues, and more all feed your GitPet—keeping it happy, healthy, and evolving as you code.

## 🎮 How It Works

Try out a simulation [here](https://gh.io/gitpet). Every time you interact with GitHub, your GitPet notices! Here's how your activity affects your pet:

| GitHub Action          | Effect on GitPet            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ✅ Commit code          | Feeds your pet              |
| 🔁 Open a pull request | Boosts energy               |
| 🐛 Open/close issues   | Adds experience             |
| 💬 Review a PR         | Increases friendliness      |
| 💤 Go inactive         | Pet gets a little lonely... |

The more consistent your contributions, the happier and more vibrant your GitPet becomes.
