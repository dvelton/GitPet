# GitPet: GitHub Engagement Tamagotchi

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: GitPet visualizes GitHub coding activity as a virtual pet that thrives or suffers based on your engagement patterns.
- **Success Indicators**: Users regularly check their pet's status, leading to more consistent GitHub activity and better coding practices.
- **Experience Qualities**: Playful, Motivating, Personalized

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting (with the pet and, by extension, their GitHub habits)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Many developers struggle with consistent GitHub engagement and good coding practices.
- **User Context**: Developers will engage with this during their workday, as a fun visualization that provides gentle feedback about their coding habits.
- **Critical Path**: User connects → Pet forms based on recent activity → User sees pet's reactions to their GitHub behaviors → User adjusts real coding habits
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Initial pet creation and discovery of its personality
  2. Seeing real-time reactions to GitHub events
  3. Experiencing the pet's disappointment when neglecting good practices

## Essential Features
1. **Pet Visualization**
   - What: An animated character that visually represents GitHub activity levels
   - Why: Provides an emotional connection to abstract metrics
   - Success: Users can immediately interpret their activity levels from the pet's appearance

2. **Activity Tracking**
   - What: Integration with GitHub events (commits, PRs, reviews, etc.)
   - Why: Creates the core feedback loop between real actions and virtual pet
   - Success: Pet accurately reflects recent GitHub activity patterns

3. **Status Display**
   - What: Visual indicators of happiness, energy, growth based on coding behaviors
   - Why: Quantifies abstract metrics in an engaging way
   - Success: Users understand which actions positively or negatively affect their pet

4. **Pet Personality**
   - What: Unique pet characteristics based on coding style and preferences
   - Why: Creates a personalized experience that feels custom to each user
   - Success: Users feel their pet reflects their unique development style

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Delight, mild guilt (when neglecting good practices), pride (when maintaining consistency)
- **Design Personality**: Playful, with a touch of whimsy, but professional enough for a work context
- **Visual Metaphors**: Garden/growth, pet care, emotional expression
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimalist interface with rich character animations

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent
- **Primary Color**: oklch(0.65 0.2 230) - A calm blue representing focus and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: oklch(0.7 0.15 260) - A soft purple for growth indicators
- **Accent Color**: oklch(0.75 0.18 140) - A vibrant green for positive actions and celebrations
- **Color Psychology**: Blues and purples create a calm, focused environment, while green accents highlight growth and success
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations maintain AA contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)) / Foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 240))
  - Card (oklch(0.95 0.01 240)) / Card Foreground (oklch(0.25 0.02 240))
  - Primary (oklch(0.65 0.2 230)) / Primary Foreground (oklch(0.98 0.005 240))
  - Secondary (oklch(0.7 0.15 260)) / Secondary Foreground (oklch(0.98 0.005 240))
  - Accent (oklch(0.75 0.18 140)) / Accent Foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 240))
  - Muted (oklch(0.9 0.02 240)) / Muted Foreground (oklch(0.4 0.02 240))

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Playful display font for headings, clean sans-serif for body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between pet status, metrics, and explanatory text
- **Font Personality**: Friendly and approachable, but professional
- **Readability Focus**: Short, scannable status updates with clear visual hierarchy
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing throughout the interface
- **Which fonts**: "Nunito" for headings (friendly rounded edges), "Inter" for body text (excellent readability)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts are highly legible at various sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Pet animation as the focal point, with status metrics arranged around it
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous white space to create a calm, focused experience
- **Grid System**: Simple card-based layout with consistent spacing
- **Responsive Approach**: Centered single-column layout that works well on all devices
- **Content Density**: Low density, focusing on the emotional impact of the pet's state

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Animations show pet's emotional state and reactions to GitHub events
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Pet animations are most prominent, with subtle UI animations for feedback
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Playful for the pet character, subtle for the interface elements

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for status sections, progress indicators for metrics, avatars for pet visualization
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners and subtle shadows for a friendly feel
- **Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for GitHub activities (code, merge, review)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Pet as primary element, status cards as secondary, actions as tertiary
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px base spacing grid (Tailwind's default)
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack cards vertically on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent spacing and colors
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, and component variations
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card shapes and spacing create a harmonious experience
- **Brand Alignment**: Playful but professional, aligned with GitHub's developer-focused identity

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text elements, with clear visual distinction between states

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: New GitHub users with limited activity history
- **Edge Case Handling**: Provide default "baby" pet state for new users
- **Technical Constraints**: Limited to activities visible through GitHub's API

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for additional GitHub metrics and pet personalities over time
- **Testing Focus**: Pet personality algorithm and emotional response mapping
- **Critical Questions**: How to balance playfulness with actual productivity motivation?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines emotional design with practical metrics, creating an experience that's both useful and delightful.
- We've assumed users will check their pet regularly - we may need to explore notification strategies.
- To make this solution truly exceptional, the pet's personality should feel genuinely responsive to the user's unique GitHub patterns.
